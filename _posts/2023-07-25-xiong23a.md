title: Bias-Variance Tradeoffs for Designing Simultaneous Temporal Experiments
abstract: 'We study the analysis and design of simultaneous temporal experiments,
  where a set of interventions are applied concurrently in continuous time, and outcomes
  are measured on a sequence of events observed in time. As a motivating setting,
  suppose multiple data science teams are conducting experiments simultaneously and
  independently on a ride- hailing platform to test changes to marketplace algorithms
  such as pricing and matching, and estimating effects from observed event outcomes
  such as the rate at which ride requests are completed. The design problem involves
  partitioning a continuous space of time into intervals and assigning treatments
  at the interval level. Design and analysis must account for three factors: carryover
  effects from interventions at earlier times, correlation in event outcomes, and
  effects of interventions tested simultaneously. We provide simulations to build
  intuition and guidance for practitioners.'
