title: Leveraging covariate adjustments at scale in online A/B testing
abstract: 'Companies offering web services routinely run randomized online experiments
  to estimate the “causal impact” associated with the adoption of new features and
  policies on key performance metrics of interest. These experiments are used to estimate
  a variety of effects: the increase in click rate due to the repositioning of a banner,
  the impact on subscription rate as a consequence of a discount or special offer,
  etc. In these settings, even effects whose sizes are very small can have large downstream
  impacts. The simple difference in means estimator (Splawa-Neyman et al., 1923/1990)
  is still the standard estimator of choice for many online A/B testing platforms
  due to its simplicity. This method, however, can fail to detect small effects, even
  when the experiment contains thousands or millions of observational units. As a
  byproduct of these experiments, however, large amounts of additional data (covariates)
  are collected. In this paper, we discuss benefits, costs and risks of allowing experimenters
  to leverage more complicated estimators that make use of covariates when estimating
  causal effects of interest. We adapt a recently proposed general-purpose algorithm
  for the estimation of causal effects with covariates to the setting of online A/B
  testing. Through this paradigm, we implement several covariate-adjusted causal estimators.
  We thoroughly evaluate their performance at scale, highlighting benefits and shortcomings
  of different methods. We show on real experiments how “covariate- adjusted” estimators
  can (i) lead to more precise quantification of the causal effects of interest and
  (ii) fix issues related to imbalance across treatment arms — a practical concern
  often overlooked in the literature. In turn, (iii) these more precise estimates
  can reduce experimentation time, cutting cost and helping to streamline decision-making
  processes, allowing for faster adoption of beneficial interventions.'
