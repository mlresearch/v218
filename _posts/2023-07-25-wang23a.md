title: 'Towards Optimization and Model Selection for Domain Generalization: A Mixup-guided
  Solution'
abstract: 'The distribution shifts between training and test data typically undermine
  the performance of deep learning models. In recent years, lots of work pays attention
  to domain generaliza- tion (DG) where distribution shift exists and target data
  are unseen. Despite the progress in algorithm design, two foundational factors have
  long been ignored: 1) the optimization for regularization-based objectives (e.g.,
  distribution alignment), and 2) the model selection for DG since no knowledge about
  the target domain can be utilized. In this paper, we pro- pose Mixup guided optimization
  and selection techniques for domain generalization. For optimization, we utilize
  an adapted Mixup to generate an out-of-distribution dataset that can guide the preference
  direction and optimize with Pareto optimization. For model selec- tion, we generate
  a validation dataset with a closer distance to the target distribution, and thereby
  it can better represent the target data. We also present some theoretical insights
  behind our proposals. Comprehensive experiments on one visual classification benchmark
  and three time-series benchmarks demonstrate that our model optimization and selection
  techniques can largely improve the performance of existing domain generalization
  algo- rithms and even achieve new state-of-the-art results.'
