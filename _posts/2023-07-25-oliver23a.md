title: 'Causally Learning an Optimal Rework Policy '
abstract: " In manufacturing, rework refers to an optional step of a production process
  which aims to eliminate errors or remedy products that do not meet the desired quality
  standards. Reworking a production lot involves repeating a previous production stage
  with adjustments to ensure that the final product meets the required specifications.
  While offering the chance to improve the yield and thus increase the revenue of
  a production lot, a rework step also incurs additional costs. Additionally, the
  rework of parts that already meet the target specifications may damage them and
  decrease the yield. In this paper, we apply double/debiased machine learning (DML)
  to estimate the conditional treatment effect of a rework step during the color conversion
  process in optoelectronic semiconductor manufacturing on the final product yield.
  We utilize the implementation DoubleML to develop policies for the rework of components
  and estimate their value empirically. From our causal machine learning analysis
  we derive implications for the coating of monochromatic LEDs with conversion layers."
