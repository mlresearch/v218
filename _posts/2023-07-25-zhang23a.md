title: Stable Prediction on Graphs with Agnostic Distribution Shifts
abstract: Most graph neural networks (GNNs) are proposed and evaluated under independent
  and identically distributed (IID) training and testing data. In real-world applications,
  however, agnostic distribution shifts from training to testing naturally exist,
  leading to unstable prediction of traditional GNNs. To bridge the gap, we pursue
  stable prediction on graphs, i.e., to achieve high average performance and low performance
  variance (stability) across non-IID testing graphs. The key to stable prediction
  lies in capturing stable properties that are resilient to distribution shifts. In
  this light, we aim to identify neighbor nodes (properties) in neighborhood aggregation
  that are consistently important for prediction under heterogeneous distribution
  shifts. To achieve this target, we propose a model-agnostic stable learning framework
  for GNNs. The framework performs biased selection on the observed training graph,
  resulting in multiple non-IID graph subsets. We train one weight predictor per subset
  to measure the importance of properties under a particular distribution shift, and
  multiple predictors could tell the properties that are consistently important. An
  important property should contribute to high average performance and also stability
  (low performance variance) across non-IID subsets. In this regard, in training importance
  predictors, we introduce a globally stable regularizer to reduce the variance of
  training losses across non-IID graph datasets. Based on the importance weights of
  properties across non- IID subsets, a locally stable regularizer down-weights unstable
  properties in prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on several graph benchmarks
  and a noisy industrial recommendation dataset where distribution shifts exist. The
  results demonstrate that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art GNNs for
  stable prediction on graphs with agnostic distribution shifts.
