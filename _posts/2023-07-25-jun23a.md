title: Optimizing Dynamic Antibiotic Treatment Strategies against Invasive Methicillin-Resistant
  Staphylococcus Aureus Infections using Causal Survival Forests and G-Formula on
  Statewide Electronic Health Record Data
abstract: Developing models for individualized, time-varying treatment optimization
  from observational data with large variable spaces, e.g., electronic health records
  (EHR), is problematic because of inherent, complex bias that can change over time.
  Traditional methods such as the g-formula are robust, but must identify critical
  subsets of variables due to combinatorial issues. Machine learning approaches such
  as causal survival forests have fewer constraints and can provide fine-tuned, individualized
  counterfactual predictions. In this study, we aimed to optimize time-varying antibiotic
  treatment –identifying treatment heterogeneity and conditional treatment effects–
  against invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections,
  using statewide EHR data collected in Florida, USA. While many previous studies
  focused on measuring the effects of the first empiric treatment (i.e., usually vancomycin),
  our study focuses on dynamic sequential treatment changes, comparing possible vancomycin
  switches with other antibiotics at clinically relevant time points, e.g., after
  obtaining a bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. Our study population included
  adult individuals admitted to the hospital with invasive MRSA. We collected demographic,
  clinical, medication, and laboratory information from the EHR for these patients.
  Then, we followed three sequential antibiotic choices (i.e., their empiric treatment,
  subsequent directed treatment, and final sustaining treatment), evaluating 30-day
  mortality as the outcome. We applied both causal survival forests and g-formula
  using different clinical intervention policies. We found that switching from vancomycin
  to another antibiotic im- proved survival probability, yet there was a benefit from
  initiating vancomycin compared to not using it at any time point. These findings
  show consistency with the empiric choice of vancomycin before confirmation of MRSA
  and shed light on how to manage switches on course. In conclusion, this application
  of causal machine learning on EHR demonstrates utility in modeling dynamic, heterogeneous
  treatment effects that cannot be evaluated precisely using randomized clinical trials.
